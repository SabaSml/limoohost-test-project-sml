# Limohost Test Project 🍋

This is a test project developed as part of the recruitment process for **Limohost**.

## ✨ About the Project

- This was my **first experience** working with React-based frameworks and **Material UI (MUI)**.
- I focused on delivering a clean, functional result within a short time frame.
- The goal was to demonstrate my ability to quickly learn and apply new technologies.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- Custom components, RTL layout, and responsive design.

## ⏱ Delivery

I made sure to deliver the project **as soon as possible**, despite it being my first time with these tools.
